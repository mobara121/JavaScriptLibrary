    notes on variables:
        - a variable must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
        - numbers may follow the above characters, but cannot come first
        - javascript is case sensitive - hello and Hello are different variables
        - no spaces are allowed in variable names
        - camelCase is the best practice for naming variables
                camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase
